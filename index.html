              <pr>The nice thing about beginning hiking is that you don't really need any
              special gear, you can probably get away with things you already have.
               Let's start with clothing. 
               A typical mistake hiking beginners make is wearing
              jeans and regular clothes, which will get heavy and chafe wif they get
               sweaty or wet.</pr>

             <p>To start,print out the hiking guide and map.If its raining ,throw them in a Zip-lock bag.Read over the guide,study the map, and have a good idea of what to expect .I like to know what my next landmark is as i hike.For example I'll read the guide and know that say in a mile,I make a right turn at the junction...</p>
